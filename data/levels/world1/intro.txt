  (text "-A nICE walk... Or not.

	Tux was just walking around Icy Island one day,
	when a penguin named Adel attacked him and stole
	his crystals! He was protecting those crystals
	to stop something bad from happening as the
	crystals have a lot of power, and he still had
	one, but he didn't know that.

	And now, Tux needed to get those crystals back!
	So he prepared himself for the dangerous journey
	ahead, and started running.") )
